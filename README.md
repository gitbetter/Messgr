**Messgr** is a simple chat application created as a school project for educational purposes. The current server implementation
is running headlessly on a server. The one shown here provides a basic GUI that logs server events. **Messgr** is currently incomplete
but is open to community contributions. The basic functionality has already been implemented, but improvements are welcome. I have
not finished it as I abandoned the project when the class was over, but hope to complete it sometime in the future.

Currently the easiest way to run it is to download the zip, unzip anywhere, and run `java Messgr` from a terminal. The class file is included precompiled,
but you will need `javac` if you wish to make any modifications.
